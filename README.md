Fetch Frontend Take-Home Exercise
Here at Fetch, we love dogs, and hope you do too! Your task is to build a website to help a dog-lover like yourself search through a database of shelter dogs, with the hope of finding a lucky dog a new home!

General Requirements
- [ ] You first should have users enter their name and email on a login screen.
- [ ] You should use this information to hit our login endpoint to authenticate with our service (see API Reference below).

- [ ] Users must be able to filter by breed
- [ ] Results should be paginated
- [ ] Results should be sorted alphabetically by breed by default.
- [ ] Users should be able to modify this sort to be ascending or descending.
- [ ] All fields of the Dog object (except for id) must be presented in some form
- [ ] Users should be able to select their favorite dogs from the search results.
- [ ] When finished searching, they should be able to generate a match based on dogs added to the favorites list.
- [ ] A single match will be generated by sending all favorited dog IDs to the /dogs/match endpoint.
- [ ] You should display this match however you see fit.

As for everything else, you have free rein, so get creative! We strongly encourage you to go beyond the minimum requirements to build something that showcases your strengths.
